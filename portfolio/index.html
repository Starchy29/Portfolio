                    I am a fifth year Game Design and Development student in a five year BS/MS program at the Rochester Institute
                    of Technology. I specialize in designing and programming games,
                    but I care about all aspects of game development.

                        In Gameplay and Prototyping class, four teammates and I had four weeks to create an RPG.
                        My team created a turn-based tactics game in Unity where space miners must extract resources from an asteroid
                        while fighting off wild aliens. I was responsible for designing the structure
                        of the randomized levels to guarantee complex combat situations. I also programmed the enemies and special abilities.

                        Four classmates and I had a three week assignment in Gameplay and Prototyping class where we had to
                        create a game with "meaningful play". We decided to create a game about language barriers. 
                        You must navigate conversations at a new alien school while learning one word at a time.
                        I was responsible for programming the language translation system, where English text
                        is covered up with alien letters.

                        In Game Development Processes, we had a semester long project to practice development processes. As a 
                        constraint, we had to design a game about a real-life animal, so I formed a team with
                        three classmates around the concept of chameleons. We created a game in Unity where the player changes
                        color to match the color of the ground beneath them, making them invisible to predators. 
                        I programmed the chameleon's movement, color changing, and color matching mechanics. 
                        I also volunteered myself as the artist and illustrated all of the visual assets.

                        In my first half of college, I used my time during Summers to make my own platformer in Monogame.
                        The player plays as a blob of mysterious science goop escaping a lab. 
                        They switch between three different textures (bouncy, slippery, and sticky), which each have different movement
                        abilities. In addition to programming the game, I programmed a level editor so I could easily design levels.
                        I designed 34 levels total, composed 4 music tracks, and illustrated all of the art assets.

                        In Game Design and Development 2, four classmates and I created an action stealth game.
                        We used Unity as our game engine and C# as our scripting language.
                        The player plays as a ghost hired by fellow ghosts to scare humans out of haunted houses.
                        They must avoid the light from the humans' flashlights and jump scare them from behind.
                        I composed background music and designed 10 levels for it. I also programmed the enemy movement patterns.

                        My high school offered seniors the option to do a personal project for a graduation distinction.
                        I decided to use the opportunity to try and make my first video game. To do this, I learned how to
                        program in Python through an online tutorial. I knew very little about programming games, so I learned
                        a lot through trial and error.
                        The core mechanic is the ability to swap the direction of gravity, and I managed
                        to design 14 puzzle levels with this concept.

                        In Game Engine Design and Development class, I teamed up with a classmate 
                        to create a virtual museum of graphics programming techniques.
                        We added onto our work from Foundations of Game Graphics Programming class.
                        My key contributions were blur, dithered transparency, and cel shading. I also programmed the first person movement
                        and set up code architecture to make constructing the rooms of the museum very simple.

                        The final project for my graduate Game Design class was to design additional content for an existing game.
                        We were allowed to add one mechanic to the game, so I came up with a new word block for <i>Baba is You</i>.
                        I created a design document that pitches the mechanic and explains how it would interact with 
                        the existing mechanics in the game. Then, I designed three puzzle levels to show how the new mechanic 
                        could be used.

                        Our final project for Rich Media Web App Development was to create a web app that combines two different APIs.
                        I decided to use a grammar API to randomly generate poetry then add a fancy background image using an image
                        API. It randomly generates sentence structures using parts of speech, then fills in the blanks with a selection
                        of words that I thought sounded poetic. There is also an option to use any random word, which makes for some
                        truly absurd poetry. I also figured out how to let people download poems that they like.
