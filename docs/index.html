                    I am a recent graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology with 
                    both a bachelors and a masters in Game Design and Development.
                    I specialize in designing and programming games,
                    but I care about all aspects of game development.

                        My key contributions were blur, dithered transparency, and cel shading. I also programmed the first person movement
                        and set up code architecture to make constructing the rooms of the museum very simple.

                        I used my knowledge of graphics code and game engines to create code architecture that faciliated creating, drawing, and updating game objects.
                        Then I used the engine to script the game mechanics.

                        Then I used an image API to find a background image that matches the poem.
